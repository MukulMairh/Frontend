    <h4>by Kanye West</h4>
    <pre>Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
        Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
        Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
        Look at ya, look at ya (ladies and gentlemen)
        Look at ya, look at ya (ladies, ladies and gentlemen)
        And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
        You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
        I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
        So I think it's time (so I think it's time)
        For us to have a toast
        Let's have a toast for the douche bags
        Let's have a toast for the assholes
        Let's have a toast for the scumbags
        Every one of them that I know
        Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
        That'll never take work off
        Baby, I got a plan
        Run away fast as you can
        She find pictures in my email
        I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
        I don't know what it is with females
        But I'm not too good at that shit
        See, I could have me a good girl
        And still be addicted to them hood rats
        And I just blame everything on you
        At least you know that's what I'm good at
        And I always find
        Yeah, I always find
        Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
        You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
        I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
        So I think it's time (so I think it's time)
        For us to have a toast

        That'll never take work off
        Baby, I got a plan
        Run away fast as you can
        Run away from me, baby
        Run away
        Run away from me, baby
        Run away
        When it starts to get crazy, then run away
        Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
        Run away from me, baby
        Run away
        Run away from me, baby
        Run away
        When it starts to get crazy
        Why can't she just run away?
        Baby, I got a plan
        Run away as fast as you can
        Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five
        Pussy stays on my mind
        I-I-I-I did it
        Alright, alright, I admit it
        Now pick your next move
        You can leave or live wit' it
        Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
        Split and go where?
        Back to wearin' knockoffs? Haha
        Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
        Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
        Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
        You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
        Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
        Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
        You should leave if you can't accept the basics
        Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
        Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
        I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
        P
        Never was much of a romantic
        I could never take the intimacy
        And I know it did damage
        'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
        I guess then you at an advantage
        'Cause you could blame me for everything
        And I don't know how I'ma manage
        If one day you just up and leave
        And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
        You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
        I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
        So I think it's time (so I think it's time)
        For us to have a toast
        Let's have a toast for the douche bags
        Let's have a toast for the assholes
        Let's have a toast for the scumbags
        Every one of them that I know
        Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
        That'll never take work off
        Baby, I got a plan
        Run away fast as you can</pre>
